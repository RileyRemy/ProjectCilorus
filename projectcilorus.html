	<p>The world of Cilorus is similar the planet earth but has it
own twist when it comes to how the landmasses are
joined. The country where Micah comes from is known as
Magent. It is known as the most advanced place in all of
Cilorus. At it’s center is also known for being the most
sacred as it houses a Primarell nammed Love which resides inside of a
glass dome with ‘vessles’ that it uses to communicate. Primarell's are creatures that were created centuries ago that helped bring Cilrous out of the dark ages.</p>
