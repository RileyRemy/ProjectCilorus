<center><h1>The Flores Within</h1>
	
	<center><p>In the universe Cilorous everyone has their own ability granted to
them through Flores. Flores are similar to magic, chakaras, or even energies that granted by Primarells of that region. Usually the rule of thumb is if you were born where that specific Primarells resides you will have their Flores. Micah has a tremendous amount of it and with it the ability to transform parts of his body into steel, whlist calling upon his own magical powess. Due to his timeline most of the steel weapons he prefers becoming range from lances to gaulting guns.</p>
